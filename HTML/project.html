        <h1>Project Story: Job Listings Analysis</h1>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In this project, we aimed to analyze job listings for a specific search word to understand the
                requirements
                and technologies sought by employers. We used various libraries and technologies to achieve this goal,
                and
                we also explored the concept of PageRank to rank the pages we retrieved.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
            <p>We leveraged several interesting technologies throughout the project:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Requests library:</strong> This library was used to send HTTP requests and retrieve HTML
                    pages
                    containing job listings.</li>
                <li><strong>BeautifulSoup library:</strong> We utilized this library to parse and process the HTML pages
                    returned by the requests.</li>
                <li><strong>Pandas library:</strong> This library was essential for saving the extracted data into
                    DataFrames, which were later exported to CSV files for further analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>NLTK library:</strong> We used NLTK to process text, specifically to remove stop-words from
                    the
                    job requirements we extracted.</li>
                <li><strong>RE library:</strong> This library helped us find specific patterns in the text, such as
                    extracting relevant keywords.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Runtime Analysis</h2>
            <p>
                We conducted two main queries:
                <br><strong>For the first query</strong> - the runtime was approximately 1.5 minutes.
                <br><strong>For the second query</strong> - the runtime for a single execution ranged from 1.5 to 2
                minutes.
                <br><br>The primary factor affecting the runtime was bypassing LinkedIn’s bot detection and the time
                required to send various requests.
                <br><br>The processing time was <strong>negligible</strong>, taking only a fraction of a second to
                extract text, process
                it,
                save it in a DataFrame, and export it to a CSV file;
                with a fast internet connection and proximity to LinkedIn’s servers, the runtime could potentially
                be reduced to less than a minute.
            </p>

        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Page Structure and Links</h2>
            <p>Our system returned two types of queries:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Query 1:</strong> The pages returned were mainly 48 independent pages. We sent 48 requests
                    that
                    weren’t connected, resulting in no hubs or authorities.</li>
                <li><strong>Query 2:</strong> The pages returned included one hub page containing 60 links to the first
                    60
                    job listings. Each job listing was a stand-alone page, making these the authority pages, with 60 in
                    total.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>PageRank Calculation with Random Walks</h2>
            <p>Given our system's structure with one hub and several authorities (with no connections between
                authorities),
                we used a variation of the PageRank formula incorporating random walks. Each authority page had a 10%
                chance
                to link to a different page. Here are the results from three runs:</p>

            <h3>Run 1:</h3>
            <img src="Run1.png" alt="PageRank Run 1">

            <h3>Run 2:</h3>
            <img src="Run2.png" alt="PageRank Run 2">

            <h3>Run 3:</h3>
            <img src="Run3.png" alt="PageRank Run 3">

            <p>We observed that the hub page consistently had the lowest PageRank, which is logical given that no pages
                had
                explicit links pointing to the hub page. Additionally, the order of the authority pages varied due to
                the
                randomness in the 10% chance of linking out to other nodes. The final ranking was calculated by
                averaging
                the rankings from all three runs:</p>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>User Feedback and Query Optimization</h2>
            <p>We asked three users to rank our PageRank results and provide feedback to perform query optimization.
                Here
                are their rankings and relevant keywords:</p>
