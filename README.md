<h1>Information Retrieval Course</h1>
<P>This repository includes several assigments we were given in the course "Information Retrieval" course by Dr. Naomi Unkelos-Shpigel</P>
<p>During the course we created a crawler that scrapes LinkedIn job listings and exports the relevant listings to a csv file according to the user's requirements</p>
