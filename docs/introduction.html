        <h1>Introduction: Motivation and Analysis</h1>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p><strong>First and foremost</strong>, we aim to present the most sought-after fields and technologies in the industry, based on newly opened job positions.</p>
            <p><strong>Additionally</strong>, we strive to present job search statistics based on levels of experience and areas of specialization, tailored to the required experience levels.</p>
            <p><strong>Finally</strong>, we intend to suggest missing fields for specific job positions, customized to the user's profile. This includes recommending courses or training programs.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Information Extraction Requirements</h2>
            <p>We need to extract specific information from job listings to answer two key questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Number of Job Positions:</strong> We will extract the number of job positions open for a specific skill, library, or description (e.g., 'Software Development', 'Databases').</li>
                <li><strong>Skills Needed:</strong> We will extract the skills required for a specific job position.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Query Implementation for Extracting Job Positions</h2>
            <p><strong>For the first requirement</strong>, we use a set of queries:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We execute the following query for a specific search word (e.g., 'tensorflow'): 
                    <code>f'https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3822734767&f_AL=true&geoId=101620260&keywords={search_word}&location=Israel&origin=JOB_SEARCH_PAGE_SEARCH_BUTTON&refresh=true'</code>.</li>
                <li>We then extract the title from the page using <code>soup.find('title')</code> as the number of jobs is typically found there.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Query Implementation for Extracting Skills</h2>
            <p><strong>For the second requirement</strong>, the following steps are used:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Find all job listings using: <code>soup.find('ul', class_='jobs-search__results-list').find_all('li')</code>.</li>
                <li>Extract the link to the job listing with: <code>li.find('a')['href']</code>.</li>
                <li>Extract the requirements from the description section using: <code>soup_job_details.find('div', class_='description__text').find('section').find('div').find_all('ul')</code>.</li>
                <li>Filter the relevant parts using keywords like "experience" or "years".</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Example and Results</h2>
            <p>To illustrate the process, we executed the query for the term "tensorflow". This resulted in 47 job listings, with the 15 most common words being:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>experience:</strong> 232 occurrences</li>
                <li><strong>learning:</strong> 61 occurrences</li>
                <li><strong>data:</strong> 60 occurrences</li>
                <li><strong>years:</strong> 43 occurrences</li>
                <li><strong>machine:</strong> 37 occurrences</li>
                <li><strong>tensorflow:</strong> 32 occurrences</li>
                <li><strong>pytorch:</strong> 31 occurrences</li>
                <li><strong>frameworks:</strong> 29 occurrences</li>
                <li><strong>models:</strong> 28 occurrences</li>
                <li><strong>working:</strong> 26 occurrences</li>
                <li><strong>cloud:</strong> 26 occurrences</li>

                <li><strong>deep:</strong> 23 occurrences</li>
                <li><strong>3:</strong> 23 occurrences</li>
                <li><strong>ml:</strong> 23 occurrences</li>
